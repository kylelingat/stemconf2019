            The Hui Manu-o-Kū is a group of conservationists and citizens that
            all have one thing in common: an interest and admiration for White
            Terns, or Manu-o-Kū. This group has formed to ensure that the
            official bird of Honolulu is taken care of and watched after.
            Manu-o-Kū is a very unique bird, especially for an urban center like
            Honolulu. We developed a citizen science initiative to help track
            the growing population in the city. Together, the Hui Manu-o-Kū and
            citizen scientists will ensure that the population is protected and
            cared for, so that they continue to thrive in Honolulu.
